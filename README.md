pText is a library for creating and manipulating PDF files in python.

## 0. About pText

pText is a pure python library to read, write and manipulate PDF documents. It represents a PDF document as a JSON-like datastructure of nested lists, dictionaries and primitives (numbers, string, booleans, etc)

This is currently a one-man project, so the focus will always be to support those use-cases that are more common in favor of those that are rare.

## 1. About the Examples

Most examples double as tests, you can find them in the 'tests' directory.  
They include; 
- reading a PDF and extracting meta-information
- changing meta-information  
- extracting text from a PDF
