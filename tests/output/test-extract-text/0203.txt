Your life, Your health
Lifestyle advice continued…
Eat foods containing plenty of ﬁbre.
Fibre from food stays in your gut and
adds bulk and softness to the stools.
You may have some bloating
and wind at ﬁrst, and it can take
up to four weeks to help your
constipation. So it is best to increase
your ﬁbre slowly and make it a long
term change. You will also need to
drink lots of water with your high
ﬁbre foods.
High-ﬁbre foods include:
 Fruit and vegetables. Aim to
eat at least ﬁve portions of
different fruit and vegetables
each day
 Oats, nuts and seeds
 Wholegrain cereals, bran and
wholemeal pasta, bread etc *
Sorbitol is a sugar, which soften
the stools and acts like a natural
laxative. Sorbitol is found in fruits
(and juices) such as apples, apricots,
gooseberries, grapes (and raisins),
peaches, pears, plums, prunes,
raspberries and strawberries.
The amount of sorbitol is about
5-10 times higher in dried fruit.
* Sometimes bran and wholemeal
may cause more bloating and cramps
and worsen constipation in patients
with IBS
