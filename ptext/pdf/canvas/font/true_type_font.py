    A TrueType font dictionary may contain the same entries as a Type 1 font dictionary (see Table 111), with these
    differences:
    • The value of Subtype shall be TrueType.
    • The value of Encoding is subject to limitations that are described in 9.6.6, "Character Encoding".
    • The value of BaseFont is derived differently.

    The PostScript name for the value of BaseFont may be determined in one of two ways:
    • If the TrueType font program's “name” table contains a PostScript name, it shall be used.
    • In the absence of such an entry in the “name” table, a PostScript name shall be derived from the name by
    which the font is known in the host operating system. On a Windows system, the name shall be based on
    the lfFaceName field in a LOGFONT structure; in the Mac OS, it shall be based on the name of the FOND
    resource. If the name contains any SPACEs, the SPACEs shall be removed.
